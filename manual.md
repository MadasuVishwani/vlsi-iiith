About Schematic Design Of Transistor Level XOR & XNOR Gate.


XOR(exclusive OR)
For a 2 input XOR,the output of the gate is low when both the inputs are same(either both low or both high).The output is high if one and only one of the inputs is high.The function is addition modulo 2 and hence the gate is used in half adder

The schematic and truth table for 2 input A and B for XOR gate :-

Input A	Input B	Output
0	     0        0
0	     1 	      1
1	     0	      1
1	     1	      0


XNOR(exclusive OR)
For a 2 input XNOR,the output of the gate is high when both the inputs are same(either both low or both high).The output is low if one and only one of the inputs is high.

This experiment is mainly written in the JS , HTML and CSS.

The foreground of this experiment is that i took a lot of effort and found all types of codes which is available in the internet which i took it as a refernece and wrote it on my own.

How to run it:
It is in the Codes Folder.

To analyze the code please go to the SRIP folder.

Click on that.

Thank you!!

If you have any issues, please let me know.

To take part in the quiz, goto the Quiz folder which is in the Codes folder itself.
